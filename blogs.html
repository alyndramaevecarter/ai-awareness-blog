      <h4><i class="bi bi-cpu icon"></i> What is Artificial Intelligence?</h4>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses
        on creating machines and systems capable of performing tasks that normally
        require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, problem-solving,
        decision-making, and understanding language.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI systems work by analyzing large amounts of data, identifying patterns,
        and making decisions based on that data. Common examples of AI include
        voice assistants like Siri, recommendation systems on YouTube and Netflix,
        and facial recognition technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main goal of AI is to make machines smarter so they can assist humans
        in performing tasks more efficiently and accurately.

      <h4><i class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow icon"></i> Advantages and Disadvantages of AI</h4>

      <h6>Advantages of AI</h6>
      <p>
        AI helps automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
        It improves accuracy, reduces human error, and can work continuously
        without getting tired. AI is widely used in healthcare, education,
        transportation, and business.
      </p>

      <h6>Disadvantages of AI</h6>
      <p>
        Despite its benefits, AI also has disadvantages. It may reduce job
        opportunities for humans, increase dependency on machines, and raise
        ethical concerns such as data privacy and security.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, AI should be used responsibly to ensure it benefits society
        without causing harm.

      <h4><i class="bi bi-mortarboard icon"></i> AI in Education and Daily Life</h4>
      <p>
        In education, AI is used to provide personalized learning experiences,
        online tutoring systems, and automated grading. AI helps students learn
        at their own pace and improves overall learning efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        In daily life, AI is present in smartphones, smart home devices,
        navigation apps like Google Maps, and online shopping platforms.
        These systems analyze user behavior to provide better recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI has become an essential part of modern life and will continue to
        shape the future of technology and society.
